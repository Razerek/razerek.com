  Walking down a flight of stairs, a young child ran into me and flew into the air and fell onto the concrete below. Everyone stared at him while he just sat there motionless, and I walked up to him and told them how sorry I was. When he got up, he had aged about ten years, and said "It's okay, you're my brother," to which the crowd staring at both of us cheered and circled around us, picking both him and I up and hoisting us into the air like a cartoon. I then said to the kid, "actually, you're my daughter!" and the crowd and I started laughing manaically, and I yelled "cut!" as if we were on a movie set.
